Estimation of dendritic spine density in ventral tegmental area

At the time of making of this presentation the dendritic spine counting software was tailored to cortical neurons, giving sometimes unacceptable results in other brain areas.
Using FIJI and Trainable WEKA Segmentation, we trained a pixel-based classifier which can mark regions presumed to be dendritic spines. After processing and integration into an image-processing pipeline, dendritic spine density can be estimated from Golgi-Cox stain.
